## Usage
1. With Adobe Photoshop CC installed
2. Download the .zxp file in /build
3. Download [ZXPInstaller](http://zxpinstaller.com/) (This is just what I used; other .zxp installers may also work) and install the extension. Alternatively, convert the .zxp to .zip by changing the extension, and extract the files. The folder must be placed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions" To show up as an extension.
5. Launch photoshop
6. Open the panel: Window > Extensions > ExtraImproved Slider

## Issues
- Switching fg/bg colors with "x" hotkey does not immediately update the panel (requires mouse over to update)
- If the background color is selected (panel), but the foreground color is active (default color picker), sampling a color will update the panel's foreground color, instead of the background color.
